Hi! 👋 I'm a student who enjoys **building things and understanding how they work**.

I’m especially interested in **technology across both hardware and software**, and I like learning by doing rather than just reading.

---

### 🔧 Hardware Side

On the hardware side, I’ve worked with:

- **Microcontrollers** such as STM32
- **PCB design**, from schematic to layout
- **FPGA development**, including basic digital design and system integration

I enjoy the feeling of turning abstract ideas into something that actually runs on a board.

### 💻 Software Side

On the software side, I’m currently learning:

- **Deep Learning**, with hands-on experience using PyTorch
- **Visual SLAM**, including concepts like feature extraction, motion estimation, and optimization
- General programming with **C++ and Python**

I’m particularly curious about how algorithms interact with real-world data and hardware constraints.

### 📒 About This Website

This website is mainly a **personal learning log**.

I use it to:

- Document what I learn
- Summarize concepts in my own words
- Record projects, experiments, and mistakes along the way

It’s not meant to be perfect — just honest, growing, and technical.

Thanks for stopping by!
